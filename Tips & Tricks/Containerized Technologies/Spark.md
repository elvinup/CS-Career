Can use Scala, Java, or (preferably with the most support) Python to write Spark jobs that will integrate with databases like [[ScyllaDB]]

Sample Lab in [[ScyllaDB]] shows how Spark can be useful to enrich values of a database table with parallel cores at scale. Example is done with just a few values to get a sense of its ability.
